        White cane
      </h1>
      <h3 class="text-white mt-1">Background</h3>
      <p class="text-white project-text">
        Since ancient times, blind people have sought different ways to overcome their limitations, but it was not until
        1921 that José Mario Fallótico, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, discovered that the use of a white cane would serve
        to distinguish him and thus be able to help him; only that José Fallotic never patented his invention, and it
        was the American George Benham, president of the Illinois Lions Club, who later proposed a white cane with a red
        lower end for use by the visually impaired, so that they would be given priority step, his proposal was accepted
        and in a short time the use of this element became universal. Interestingly, Americans celebrate "International
        White Cane Day" on October 15, but without knowing who its inventor really was.
        Currently, the cane has become for the blind an extension of their body. Something like an external organ that
        makes up for his visual deficiencies, providing him with information while he moves the pointer with the ground,
        since it emits vibrations that are perceived by the user, these vibrations vary their intensity according to the
        circumstances of the surface, they are they exacerbate when it presents greater hardness, allowing you to
        interpret the exact situation in which you find yourself. This sensory tool guides the steps of the blind,
        allowing them to perceive the type of surface they are walking on and at the same time providing information
        about their context and location within it.
        There are currently different models of walking sticks on the market, each of which has a different type of
        grip. Their design is one or the other depending on the service they are intended to provide, depending on the
        degree of blindness of the user. Thus, the B1 model is designed to guide the totally blind, the B2, those who
        slightly distinguish between light and shadow, and finally the B3 guides the steps of the blind who still have
        some residual vision.
        However, I believe that there is still much to be done, and it would be very useful for the blind person to
        receive more information, such as a cane implemented with electronic accessories.

      <h3 class="text-white mt-3">Proximity sensor</h3>
      <p class="text-white project-text">
        Ultrasonic sensors have as their main function the detection of objects through the emission and reflection of
        acoustic waves. They work by emitting an ultrasonic pulse against existing objects, in such a way that upon
        detecting the reflected pulse, a timer is stopped that started counting when the pulse was emitted. This time is
        referred to distance and according to the chosen response parameters, it sends a digital or analog electrical
        signal.

        <h3 class="mt-4">1.1 General operation</h3>
        <p class="mt-0">It is a cane implemented with sensors that will be able to warn the blind that there is an
          obstacle before
          making physical contact with it, this will be achieved through small vibrations in the handle of the cane that
          will increase as you get closer to the obstacle and through a voice that will will indicate the distance of
          such an object.

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/block_diagram.jpg') }}" class="project-img mt-3">
        <h5 class="mt-4">1.2.1 Power supply</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage of the circuit, a high-performance 9-volt battery will be implemented to power all
          the stages
          of the circuit and the motors.</p>
        <h5>1.2.2 Load control</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage, the power supply to the different parts of the circuit is controlled since they
          work with
          different voltages such as sensors, motors, circuits, etc.</p>
        <h5>1.2.3 Proximity sensor</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">This stage is the one in charge of sending the signal depending on the distance with which the
          vibrator will
          work, since the closer the lens of the proximity sensor is, the greater the frequency with which the signal
          will bounce and in this way it is intended to convert this signal so that the vibration motor also works at a
          higher speed and in the case of voice memory to make changes in the phrases.</p>
        <h5>1.2.4 Microcontroller</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">The microcontroller is the one in charge of sending pulses and receiving the signal coming from
          the sensor
          and from there sending it to the output of P1 to be converted by a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) and sent
          to the vibration motor. If this stage is not done it will be very difficult to make it work at the desired
          speed.
          It is also responsible for controlling the voice memory of the signals that are going to be sent to it.</p>
        <h5>1.2.5 DAC</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage it is intended to convert the signal coming from the microcontroller so that the
          motor can work
          depending on the frequency that is being sent by the sensors, having this a minimum point to start with a
          small vibration being about 2 meters from the obstacle until a maximum point. with a constant vibration when
          you are very close to the obstacle.</p>
        <h5>1.2.6 Power stage</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage, what is intended is that the signal obtained from the DAC has a higher power so
          that the circuit can support the vibrating motors.</p>
        <h5>1.2.7 Vibration motor</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage is where the converted signal arrives to be able to have a speed control that
          depends on the frequency that the sensor is working, which is then converted to a voltage that will increase
          as the frequency that it sends increases, once converted into the DAC.</p>
        <h5>1.2.8 Voice memory</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">This stage receives a signal from the microcontroller that, depending on the signal sent by the
          micro, is the
          phrase that is going to be said.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">2.1.1 Power supply</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">Input power is 9 volts and is provided by a high performance battery that is small and portable
          which is why
          that type of battery was chosen.</p>
        <h5>2.1.2 Load control</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">This stage is carried out by means of voltage regulators to power the different stages of the
          circuit such as
          sensors, integrated circuits and motors, which are the ones that consume the most, reaching the conclusion of
          a 7805 regulator.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">2.1.3 Proximity sensor</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">The sensors to be used are the SRF05, the proximity sensors generate pulses that are put into
          the micro,
          which is the one in charge of making the conversion to centimeters. That pulse is a 40KHz burst which is
          received by the receiving sensor.</p>

        <p class="mt-0">The transmitter is built with a 555 and CMOS inverters, the CMOS feature is used to parallel
          them and
          increase the transmit power. The signal coupled between the positive and negative terminals is 180º out of
          phase, so the voltage applied between the terminals is doubled.</p>

        <h6 class="mt-3">receiver</h6>
        <p class="mt-0">The receiver is composed of two circuits: signal amplifier and detection circuit. The signal is
          received by
          the receiving sensor and amplified 1000 times (60dB) in two steps: one amplifier times 100 (40dB) and one
          amplifier times 10 (20dB).</p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">2.1.5 Microcontroller</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">This stage will control the motors through port 1. When an obstacle approaches, it will send a
          one or a zero to the outputs, and port 2 will send, as with the motors, a digital signal that, depending on
          the value, will call the saved message, the memory manufacturer's data sheet must be taken into account to see
          the maximum recording time.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">2.1.5 DAC</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">This stage was designed by means of the digital output sent by the micro and depending on the
          output bits, this stage will transform each digital signal into an output voltage. The DAC that was used was
          the r-2r with resistance values of 470 Ohms for r and 1KOhm for 2r.</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/images/projects/dac.jpg') }}" class="project-img">
        <h5 class="mt-4">2.1.6 Load stage</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">This stage is made up of a voltage follower and a current amplifier, this was done because what
          the DAC commands does not raise the motors and with this stage they can be raised. The Operational to be used
          was the LM358N since it occupies a single source and the transistor to use was the TIP41C since it is a power
          transistor and can easily withstand vibrating motors.</p>
        <h5>2.1.7 Vibration motor</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">This is one of the final stages in which the input voltage that the motors will receive
          depending on the
          distance was designed.</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/images/projects/vibration_dac.jpg') }}" class="project-img">
        <h5 class="mt-4">2.1.8 Voice memory</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage of the voice memory, through the microcontroller, different outputs to the memory
          were designed in which they depend on the distance of an object, in which the output of the voice memory must
          be connected to a speaker or , in this case, to a female plug for playback on headphones.
          This voice memory handles several modalities in which one of them is to work in addressing mode, which
          consists of recording the voice, indicating binary numbers to the inputs, which was the one used for this
          project.</p>

        <p class="mt-0">In this stage, some ultrasonic sensors were carried out, in which at the beginning they had been
          designed
          with the transmitter and the receiver but seeing that it gave us the signal with a lot of noise, it was
          decided to change for a manufactured one (SRF05) reducing the space. In the sensors there were 2 ways to use
          the first was through two pins, one for the input and the other for the output and the second was for a single
          pin in which the inputs and outputs are inserted in the same pin. With this connection the sensor uses a
          single microcontroller line for Echo and Trigger. Care must be taken to configure the microcontroller line as
          input or output, as appropriate at any given time.</p>
        <ol class="ps-5">

        <h5 class="mt-4">4.1.3 Microcontroller</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage, a program was first designed for the operation of the ultrasonic sensors, later
          the converter program was designed in which depending on the distance at which the sensors are located, which
          is proportional to a frequency with this, it was converted into a signal of output giving it in centimeters to
          be able to be interpreted by a DAC and thus have a distance to voltage converter, and all the control of the
          motors and voice memory was done.</p>
        <h5>4.1.4 DAC</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">In this stage, experiments were carried out with a converter circuit from 1 to 5 volts, which is
          the voltage range with which the vibrating motors work from the minimum to the maximum vibration without being
          damaged. Two tests were done, one at a very close distance and the other not so close.</p>

          the
          conversion and checking that the motors worked.</p>
        <h5>4.1.6 Vibration motors</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">Here, the vibrating motors were experimented with, checking their operation from a very small
          vibration to a
          high frequency that could be varied by regulating the voltage of the motors with a maximum of 5 volts and with
          a minimum to start operating of approximately 2 volts. .</p>
        <h5>4.1.7 Voice memory</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">At this stage, the first thing that was done, once the circuit for the voice memory was
          assembled, was to
          make the recording, an address is entered and it is recorded, leaving the Chip Enable button pressed and so on
          in the addresses that were occupied, to To verify it, the switch was put into playback and the addresses were
          entered with ones and zeros and thus checking if what was entered at that address was what was reproduced.</p>

        <p class="mt-0">The method used to transfer the circuits to the board was using Couché paper:</p>

          <li>First, the copper bakelite board is cleaned<br>

          <li class="mt-4">Once printed, the ironing begins. First, align the paper with the plate, do not cut the
            baking sheet yet,
            since it is very difficult to keep it from moving when ironing.<br>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/images/projects/ironing.jpg') }}" class="project-img">
          </li>
          <li class="mt-4">Heat the iron to a little more than half and put it on the paper firmly, not moving the paper
            is very
            important. 2 or 3 passes is enough. If the iron is very hot or you pass over it many times, the tracks are
            deformed or the copper is raised.<br>

          <li class="mt-4">Check that all the tracks are stuck, one way is to look at the plate against the light in
            which you will
            see that where there is a track it is very bright<br>

          <li class="mt-4">Then let the copper bakelite board cool with the paper for a few minutes and then put it in a

            with water for 10 minutes.<br>

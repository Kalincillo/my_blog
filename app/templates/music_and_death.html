        <p class="mt-0">The main objective of this research is to investigate if there is any relationship between being
          a
          professional musician and deaths from unnatural causes (A death from natural causes is the result of a disease
          or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, which are not infectious
          diseases)</p>
        <p>In this case, the main causes are analyzed in which a psychological case directly affects the cause of death
          and not a more common case such as accidents.</p>
        <h5>10 most closely associated with death</h5>
        <ol class="ps-5">
          <li>Current smoker</li>
          <li>History of divorce</li>
          <li>History of alcohol abuse</li>
          <li>Recent financial difficulties</li>
          <li>History of unemployment</li>
          <li>Previous history as a smoker</li>
          <li>Lower life satisfaction</li>
          <li>Never married</li>
          <li>History of food stamps</li>
          <li>Negative affectivity</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="mt-0">2 of the main causes of unnatural deaths in musicians is abandonment by parents or family and
          the ease of
          obtaining drugs</p>
        <p>I started from scratch collecting data about musicians who have died unnaturally, young or in strange ways in
          a sql table to later normalize it and have all the data structured for future projects.</p>

             class="img-frame project-img mt-3">
        <p>The data cleaning process is about minimizing beforehand to make the job easier in the future</p>
        <h5>Cities, states and countries tables</h5>
        <p class="mt-0">We will use the city, state and country tables to be able to separate each artist by their
          region of birth
          and to know if it is a common factor.</p>

             class="img-frame project-img mt-2">
        <p>We will normalize the table birth to have each artist separate by their birthplace</p>

             class="img-frame project-img mt-2">
        <p>We finished wit this tables</p>

      <section class="mt-4">
        <h3>Jupyter notebook</h3>
        <p class="mt-0">After normalizing the tables we proceed to connect the database with Jupyter notebook to be able
          to do the analysis with the help of pandas libraries, matplotlib.</p>
        <h3>Install required libraries</h3>
        <p class="mt-0">We begin with the installation of the necessary libraries to be able to connect Mysql and for
          the environment
          variables</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/images/projects/software/music_death/installation.jpg') }}"
             class="img-frame project-img mt-2">
        <p>Now we import the necessary libraries for data analysis, graphing and connecting the database</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/images/projects/software/music_death/libraries.jpg') }}"
             class="img-frame project-img mt-2">
        <h3 class="mt-4">Database login</h3>
        <p class="mt-0">Next we import the host, name of database and password of MySql, saved in a separate .env file
          to protect the
          data from corruption, we use the library dotenv and the function load_dotenv() previously loaded to do this
          automatically</p>

             class="img-frame project-img mt-2">
        <h3 class="mt-4">Connect to the database</h3>
        <p class="mt-0">To connect to the database we will use Try: to prevent a failed connection and the function
          mysql.connector.connect() which as arguments will give the connection values previously loaded with
          load_env()</p>
        <p>connection.is_connected() is a function that helps us to know if the connection was successful</p>
